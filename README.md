# Word Sense Disambiguation

## Task Definition

The task of choosing the correct sense for a word is called word sense disambiguation (WSD). WSD algorithms take an input word *w* in its context with a fixed set of potential word senses S<sub>w</sub> of that input word and produce an output chosen from S<sub>w</sub>. In the isolated WSD task, one usually uses the set of senses from a dictionary or theasurus like WordNet. 

In the literature, there are actually two variants of the generic WSD task. In the lexical sample task, a small selected set of target words is chosen, along with a set of senses for each target word. For each target word *w*, a number of corpus sentences (context sentences) are manually labeled with the correct sense of *w*. In all-words task, systems are given entire sentences and a lexicon with the set of senses for each word in each sentence. Annotators are then asked to disambiguate every word in the text.

In all-words WSD, a classifier is trained to label the words in the text with their set of potential word senses. After giving the sense labels to the words in our training data, the next step is to select a group of features to discriminate different senses for each input word.

The following Table shows an example for the word 'yüz', which can refer to the number '100', to the verb 'swim' or to the noun 'face'.

|Sense|Definition|
|---|---|
|yüz<sup>1</sup> (hundred)|The number coming after ninety nine|
|yüz<sup>2</sup> (swim)|move or float in water|
|yüz<sup>3</sup> (face)|face, visage, countenance|

## Data Annotation

### Preparation

1. Collect a set of sentences to annotate. 
2. Each sentence in the collection must be named as xxxx.yyyyy in increasing order. For example, the first sentence to be annotated will be 0001.train, the second 0002.train, etc.
3. Put the sentences in the same folder such as *Turkish-Phrase*.
4. Build the [Java](https://github.com/starlangsoftware/WordSenseDisambiguation) project and put the generated sentence-semantics.jar file into another folder such as *Program*.
5. Put *Turkish-Phrase* and *Program* folders into a parent folder.

### Annotation

1. Open sentence-semantics.jar file.
2. Wait until the data load message is displayed.
3. Click Open button in the Project menu.
4. Choose a file for annotation from the folder *Turkish-Phrase*.  
5. For each word in the sentence, click the word, and choose correct sense for that word.
6. Click one of the next buttons to go to other files.

## Classification DataSet Generation

After annotating sentences, you can use [DataGenerator](https://github.com/starlangsoftware/DataGenerator-CPP) package to generate classification dataset for the Word Sense Disambiguation task.

## Generation of ML Models

After generating the classification dataset as above, one can use the [Classification](https://github.com/starlangsoftware/Classification-CPP) package to generate machine learning models for the Word Sense Disambiguation task.

## Requirements

* Xcode Editor
* [Git](#git)

### Git

Install the [latest version of Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

## Download Code

In order to work on code, create a fork from GitHub page. 
Use Git for cloning the code to your local or below line for Ubuntu:

	git clone <your-fork-git-link>

A directory called NER-Swift will be created. Or you can use below link for exploring the code:

	git clone https://github.com/starlangsoftware/WordSenseDisambiguation-Swift.git

## Open project with XCode

To import projects from Git with version control:

* XCode IDE, select Clone an Existing Project.

* In the Import window, paste github URL.

* Click Clone.

Result: The imported project is listed in the Project Explorer view and files are loaded.


## Compile

**From IDE**

After being done with the downloading and opening project, select **Build** option from **Product** menu. After compilation process, user can run WordSenseDisambiguation-Swift.

Detailed Description
============

## Sentence

In order to sense annotate a parse tree, one can use autoSemantic method of the TurkishSentenceAutoSemantic class.

	let sentence = ...
	let wordNet = WordNet();
	let fsm = FsmMorphologicalAnalyzer();
	let turkishAutoSemantic = TurkishSentenceAutoSemantic(wordnet, fsm)
	turkishAutoSemantic.autoSemantic()

For Contibutors
============

### Package.swift file

1. Dependencies should be given w.r.t github.
```
    dependencies: [
        .package(name: "MorphologicalAnalysis", url: "https://github.com/StarlangSoftware/TurkishMorphologicalAnalysis-Swift.git", .exact("1.0.6"))],
```
2. Targets should include direct dependencies, files to be excluded, and all resources.
```
    targets: [
        .target(
	dependencies: ["MorphologicalAnalysis"],
	exclude: ["turkish1944_dictionary.txt", "turkish1944_wordnet.xml",
	"turkish1955_dictionary.txt", "turkish1955_wordnet.xml",
	"turkish1959_dictionary.txt", "turkish1959_wordnet.xml",
	"turkish1966_dictionary.txt", "turkish1966_wordnet.xml",

```
3. Test targets should include test directory.
```
	.testTarget(
		name: "WordNetTests",
		dependencies: ["WordNet"]),
```

### Data files
1. Add data files to the project folder.

### Swift files

1. Do not forget to comment each function.
```
   /**
     * Returns the value to which the specified key is mapped.
     - Parameters:
        - id: String id of a key
     - Returns: value of the specified key
     */
    public func singleMap(id: String) -> String{
        return map[id]!
    }
```
2. Do not forget to define classes as open in order to be able to extend them in other packages.
```
	open class Word : Comparable, Equatable, Hashable
```
3. Function names should follow caml case.
```
	public func map(id: String)->String?
```
4. Write getter and setter methods.
```
	public func getSynSetId() -> String{
	public func setOrigin(origin: String){
```
5. Use separate test class extending XCTestCase for testing purposes.
```
final class WordNetTest: XCTestCase {
    var turkish : WordNet = WordNet()
    
    func testSize() {
        XCTAssertEqual(78326, turkish.size())
    }
```
6. Enumerated types should be declared as enum.
```
public enum CategoryType : String{
    case MATHEMATICS
    case SPORT
    case MUSIC
```
7. Implement == operator and hasher method for hashing purposes.
```
    public func hash(into hasher: inout Hasher) {
        hasher.combine(name)
    }
    public static func == (lhs: Relation, rhs: Relation) -> Bool {
        return lhs.name == rhs.name
    }
```
8. Make classes Comparable for comparison, Equatable for equality, and Hashable for hashing check.
```
	open class Word : Comparable, Equatable, Hashable
```
9. Implement < operator for comparison purposes.
```
    public static func < (lhs: Word, rhs: Word) -> Bool {
        return lhs.name < rhs.name
    }
```
10. Implement description for toString method.
```
	open func description() -> String{
```
11. Use Bundle and XMLParserDelegate for parsing Xml files.
```
	let url = Bundle.module.url(forResource: fileName, withExtension: "xml")
	var parser : XMLParser = XMLParser(contentsOf: url!)!
	parser.delegate = self
	parser.parse()
```
also use parser method.
```
public func parser(_ parser: XMLParser, didStartElement elementName: String, namespaceURI: String?, qualifiedName qName: String?, attributes attributeDict: [String : String])
```
